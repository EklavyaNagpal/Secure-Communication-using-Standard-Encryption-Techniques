# Secure-Communication-using-Standard-Encryption-Techniques
CLIENT_SERVER COMMUNICATION USING AES (Advance Encryption Standard) Algorithm in C language. 
CLIENT.c file having information about how client will link with server through sockets i.e we are using socket programming for linking between client and server.
CLIENT.c file having two header files i.e (encryption.h) and (DECRYPT.h) which helps to convert the chat of client and server into encrypt and then helps to decrypt the messages.
