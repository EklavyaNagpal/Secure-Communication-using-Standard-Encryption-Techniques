# Secure-Communication-using-Standard-Encryption-Techniques
CLIENT_SERVER COMMUNICATION USING AES (Advance Encryption Standard) Algorithm in C language. 
CLIENT.c file having information about how client will link with server through sockets i.e we are using socket programming for linking between client and server.
CLIENT.c file having two header files i.e (encryption.h) and (DECRYPT.h) which helps to convert the chat of client and server into encrypt and then helps to decrypt the messages.
SERVER.c file having information about how server will link with client through sockets and SERVER.c file also contains two header files i.e (encryption.h) and (DECRYPT.h) which convert chat of client and server into encrypted format and then dercypt back to normal string. 
encryption.h and DECRYPT.h are header files having all information or code how we can encrypt our string that will taken in buffer and stores it as a hexadecimal and then it will display to server side.
As same DERCYPT.h having all information or code how we can dercypt our string that having hexadecimal values which is stored in buffer and helps to convert that string into normal string
We can done Encryption and Decryption both sides that is server as well as client side.
